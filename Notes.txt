hardware SPI on an ESP32:
default:

VSPI:
MOSI 23
MISO 19
SCLK 18
CS 5

HSPI
MOSI 13
MISO 12
SCLK 14
CS 15

in arduino IDE, these are defined as their respective names
(note: these pins can be changed)


to change SPI pins manually in a library that doesn't support custom initialization, use:
SPI.begin(SCK, MISO, MOSI, SS);


for multiple SPI busses, initialize
vspi = new SPIClass(VSPI);
hspi = new SPIClass(HSPI);

on top and bottom walls, other robots use 1.5-2mm thick shells

(we could probably do this for the internal structure as well)

for edge walls, 3-5mm will suffice (put curves so the robot cannot sit on them)
