hardware SPI on an ESP32:
default:

VSPI:
MOSI 23
MISO 19
SCLK 18
CS 5

HSPI
MOSI 13
MISO 12
SCLK 14
CS 15

in arduino IDE, these are defined as their respective names
(note: these pins can be changed)


to change SPI pins manually in a library that doesn't support custom initialization, use:
SPI.begin(SCK, MISO, MOSI, SS);


for multiple SPI busses, initialize
vspi = new SPIClass(VSPI);
hspi = new SPIClass(HSPI);

on top and bottom walls, other robots use 1.5-2mm thick shells

(we could probably do this for the internal structure as well)

for edge walls, 3-5mm will suffice (put curves so the robot cannot sit on them)






Controller template was gotten from here:

Futaba 12 channel troubles:

reset line is

long time LOW->long time HIGH


each channel has a LOW time that matches a HIGH time


A channel may unexpectedly cut out before transmission is complete, completing a "cycle" prematurely.
it will wait at least one complete cycle before finishing the half-done channel.

in order to ensure that we get good signals every time, we need to detect the bad channel pauses.
The easiest way to (possibly) do this is to only update all the channel values if we get all of them in one go.


if we detect a reset rollover, we then move the waiting signals over to the visible surface ONLY if we got all of them. Partials will not count.
