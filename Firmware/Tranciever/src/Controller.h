//note: futaba's 12 channel protocol sends time-matched pairs of low then high signals.
//We could catch either just one or both together per channel. It doesn't matter
//with current settings, input values range from 970 to 550 (+- 2 or occasionally 3 for non-edge signals)
//(right/bottom) is 970, (left/top) is 550
//on back levers, up is 550, down is 970
//on front knobs, CCW is MAX (1033), CW is MIN (487) (extra due to 30% detune, more on this later)
//note: on non-lever elements, remove the self-detune (for correct normalization)

//760 is center
//when levers are UP, that mean's the're 'ON' (shorter PPM)


//on servo menu, top left is (-100, -100) [550,550], just like PC diplay coords
//bottom right is (100,100) [970,970]
//some levers detune by +-15% (full range of 30%)
//970 + detune = 1033, 970 - detune = 906
